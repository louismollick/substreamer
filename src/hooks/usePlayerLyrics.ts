/**
 * Shared player lyrics fetch coordination. Owns the store selectors, the
 * fetch-attempt guard ref, the gated effect, and the retry handler. The
 * Shared by the phone (`player-phone-portrait.tsx`) and tablet
 * (`PlayerTabletLandscape.tsx`) surfaces.
 *
 * Fetch policy: lyrics load only while a player surface is on screen
 * (`enabled`) and the app is foreground. App-active is read here rather than at
 * each call site so no call site can forget it, and the effect re-runs when
 * either gate opens — so a player opened on an already-playing track loads that
 * track's lyrics instead of waiting for the next track change.
 *
 * No refresh handler: neither surface exposes one for lyrics, matching the
 * existing UX (refresh is album-info only).
 *
 * Timeout / error-reset semantics live inside `lyricsStore.fetchLyrics()`
 * (15s `withTimeout`), so this hook is a thin coordination layer.
