/**
 * "Download Full Library" — a one-shot that queues every album then every
 * playlist for offline download, reusing the standard download queue (which
 * already handles concurrency, dedup, status, storage limits, retries, resume).
 *
 * Light by design: refresh the album/playlist lists, then loop-enqueue. Each
 * `enqueueAlbumDownload` fetches the album's song list and dedups, so per-album
 * metadata freshens inline and already-cached albums are skipped with no
 * transfer. Playlists go last — their songs are usually already on disk from the
 * albums, so they complete quickly. Re-running is safe (idempotent).
