/**
 * Persistent Zustand store for offline music cache state (v2).
 *
 * No `persist(createJSONStorage(...))` middleware — persistence is split three ways:
 *   - `cachedSongs`, `cachedItems`, and `downloadQueue` are persisted per-row
 *     via `./persistence/musicCacheTables`.
 *   - `maxConcurrentDownloads` is persisted as a tiny JSON blob under
 *     `substreamer-music-cache-settings` in `kvStorage`.
 *   - `totalBytes` / `totalFiles` are derived aggregates, recomputed from the
 *     filesystem on startup via `recalculate(...)` (the service layer owns
 *     the walk).
 *
 * Every action writes through to the persistence layer BEFORE mutating the
 * in-memory state, so an observer reacting to the store change can trust that
 * disk is already in sync.
