 * True when an album `cached_items` row represents a partial download —
 * fewer songs on disk than the album actually contains.
 *
 * `expectedSongCount` is authoritative: `ensurePartialAlbumEdge` fetches the
 * album from the server when the album-detail store doesn't have it, so the
 * count always reflects the real album size and no heuristic is needed to tell
 * a genuine single-track album from a fallback estimate.
 *
 * Songs and playlists never classify as partial — songs are 1/1 by
 * definition, playlists download atomically in v2.
 *
 * The SQL form of this rule lives in `db/repository/downloads.ts`
 * (`partialGate`), which is what every downloaded FILTER now reads. This
 * copy serves the callers that hold a `CachedItemRow` in hand already —
 * the cache browser and the download-status hook.
